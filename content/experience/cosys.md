### Implementing a 5G Network Emulator using Open Air Interface

During my internship at the COSYS-ERENA research laboratory at Université Gustave Eiffel, I worked on implementing a 5G network emulator based on the Open Air Interface platform. This internship provided an opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research in cellular communication technologies.

###### Key Responsibilities and Achievements:
Study and Documentation Review: I thoroughly reviewed documentation related to the Open Air Interface platform and associated tools such as Open5GS and Docker.
5G Network Implementation: I learned how to set up 5G access networks using USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) and COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) user terminals. Leveraging tutorials and the expertise of colleagues, I successfully implemented an end-to-end 5G architecture (RAN, Backhaul, and Core Network).
Testing and Evaluation: I tested and evaluated the architecture's performance and explored potential use cases within the emulated environment.
Reporting and Research: I documented the findings and contributed to the potential publication of a research paper highlighting the study's main conclusions.
Skills and Tools Utilized:
Technologies: 5G, Open Air Interface, USRP, Quality of Service, Network Slicing
Tools: Mininet, Omnet, Open5GS, Docker
Competencies: Telecommunication Networks, Cellular Architectures, Autonomous Research, Adaptability to Research Environments, Proficiency in English (oral and written)
Context and Impact:
Cellular telecommunication networks, currently in the fifth generation (5G) and moving towards the sixth generation (6G), aim to support a broad range of applications such as multimedia services, critical services, and IoT services. My work at COSYS-ERENA focused on enhancing network slicing and edge computing solutions, particularly in the context of Intelligent and Cooperative Transport Systems and Connected Trains. The transition from simulated to emulated 5G architecture aimed to overcome performance and realism limitations, leveraging real access networks and open-source core networks.

This internship experience allowed me to gain hands-on expertise in 5G network technologies, contributing to research that supports advancements in smart cities, automated vehicles, telemedicine, and critical infrastructure resilience.
